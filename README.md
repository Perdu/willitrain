Will it rain?
=============

Just a simple script to check whether it will rain today and send me an email if it is the case, because I could not find a simple script to do that.

# Install

Add script to your crontab. You will receive emails if your server is configured to do so.

Copy `location_config.sh.example` to `location_config.sh` and add the desired location. You can get a precise location on Google Maps by right clicking â†’ more info on this location.
